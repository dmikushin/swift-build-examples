# CMake Swift Examples

Example project which demonstrates CMake features used to build Swift code

## What this is

These are example projects which demonstrate how to use the new Swift support
in CMake to build a project using modern CMake techniques.

## Why use this

CMake is a meta-build system that allows you to generate the build rules using
different build tools.  It also makes it possible to setup the build in a way
which supports cross-compiling for various targets (including Linux, Windows,
and Android).

## How to build the demos

Go to the indivudual project folders and follow the instructions.

## What is supported

- Builds on Linux, macOS, and Windows

- `CMAKE GENERATOR`
  * `Ninja` (only Ninja generator is currently supported)
